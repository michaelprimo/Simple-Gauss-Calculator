# Simple-Gauss-Calculator
This repository contains the code for creating a calculator of a sum of numbers 
according to the Summation Formula of Gauss using basic HTML,CSS and vanilla JS.

I made this exercise because I wanted to make something useful while learning to code and in the meanwhile
entering in the world of Open Source and Github.
